# meta_llm_leaderboard
Meta leaderboard combines data from multiple different leaderboards about LLMs.
The focus is primarily on Open LLMs.

Todo:
- Add to automated change tracker for AgentBench - checkout repo see if a new file is present?
  - Few updates or none.. until see at least one update hold off.
- Comparison other benchmarks by model size. https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/multilingual-code-evals
  - Few models match the HF leaderboard. Better to make standalont by size chart for code bench.


Ideas:
- Create across everything chart. Show model that has been evaluated on all leaderboards.
- Add a runner-up (commercial permissible) license to HF best models.
- Work on Supernatural Instruction
- Take another look at HELM (They hardly evaluate recent open models. Not even bother with finetunes)
- https://gpt4all.io/index.html is that Test set worth it?
- https://github.com/defog-ai/sqlcoder sqlcode.. not a leaderboard but nice evaluation
