# meta_llm_leaderboard
Meta leaderboard combines data from multiple different leaderboards about LLMs.

Todo:
- Add license designation (Commercially-Permissible)
- Get manual size from model.json
- Create space to show all the diagrams.
- Add AgentBench leaderboard.
- Re-score the HF leaderboard with Truth having lower value.

Ideas:
- Create across everything chart. Show model that has been evaluated on all leaderboards.
- Add a runner-up (commercial permissible) license to HF best models.
- Work on Supernatural Instruction
