# meta_llm_leaderboard
Meta leaderboard combines data from multiple different leaderboards about LLMs.
The focus is primarily on Open LLMs.

Todo:
- Add to automated change tracker for AgentBench
- Track the code benchmark bookmarked in X
- On all the charts implement truncating model labels.
- Generate model folder make sure minutes is locked across generations.
- Create space to show all the diagrams.

Ideas:
- Create across everything chart. Show model that has been evaluated on all leaderboards.
- Add a runner-up (commercial permissible) license to HF best models.
- Work on Supernatural Instruction
- Take another look at HELM (They hardly evaluate recent open models. Not even bother with finetunes)
- https://gpt4all.io/index.html is that Test set worth it?
