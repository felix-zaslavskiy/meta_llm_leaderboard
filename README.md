# meta_llm_leaderboard
Meta leaderboard combines data from multiple different leaderboards about LLMs.

Todo:
Add license designation (Commercially-Permissible)
Create space to show all the diagrams.
Add AgentBench leaderboard.
Rescore the HF leaderboard with Truth having lower value.

Ideas:
Create across everything chart. Show model that has been evaluated on all leaderboards.
Load all the data into sqlite db for easier work or just json store.
Add a runner-up (commercial permissible) license to HF best models.
